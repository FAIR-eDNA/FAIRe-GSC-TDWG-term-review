# FAIRe term review for MIxS/DwC eDNA checklist proposal
This repository contains scripts and documentation for the TDWG/GSC eDNA task group to conduct a term-by-term review of the FAIRe checklist. 

# Background
The TDWG/GSC eDNA Task Group is working to develop an eDNA checklist under the DwC and MIxS standards.
To support this effort, a term-by-term review of the FAIRe checklist is being conducted to:
- Track the origin of each FAIRe term.
- Document how terms have been modified from their original source, e.g., MIxS, DwC, the DNA extension, and DwC-DP.
- Determine whether each term should be included in the proposed DwC/MIxS eDNA checklist.
To help visualise the decision-making process, an R function was developed to generate decision trees that capture and display the review outcomes for each term.

# General procedure for each FAIRe term
1. Create a GitHub issue for the term e.g., [Review: RecordedBy #245](https://github.com/FAIR-eDNA/FAIRe-GSC-TDWG-term-review/issues/245). <i>Note that in the modeling standard we are using, [LinkML](https://linkml.io/), 'terms' are referred to as 'slots'.</i>. (Steve - Done)
2. Raise disucssion points for the term (Miwa)
3. Add comments and feedback (all TG members) 
4. Discuss and vote durign a meeting (e.g., whether to propose the term to GSC/TDWG)
7. Review SKOS mapping (Re-visit points raised in [Issue #14](https://github.com/FAIR-eDNA/FAIRe_checklist/issues/14))
8. Update issue status from "Review started" to "Review complete"
